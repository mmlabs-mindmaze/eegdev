                             BUILD INSTRUCTIONS


Compilation from the git repository
===================================

The package scripts must be initially generated in order to compile the
library. For this, the autoconf, automake, libtool and gnulib package must
be available. 

Then the autogen.sh script can used. It will import the gnulib modules used
by the eegdev library and generate the configure scripts. If you want to use
the gnulib from a non standard path, you can specify the -g option:

    autogen.sh [-g PATH_TO_GNULIB-TOOL]

Once the package scripts are generated, you have to follow the instructions
of the compilation from a tarball.



Compilation from a tarball
==========================

This library is organized as a GNU package and can be compiled and
installed in the same way (see INSTALL file for further information).

In addition to the standard options, the configure script recognize flags
to enable or disable the support for the different backends. By default,
most of the backend are built in if the required libraries are found:

  --with-BACKEND[=yes|no|check] : enable the compilation of the plugin
                    providing the support for BACKEND. See the output of the
		    command 'configure --help' to know which BACKEND string
		    can be supplied.

Finally, if only the compilation of one or several plugin is wanted, the
compilation of the core library can be controlled by the configure option:

  --enable-corelib-build[=yes|no] : enable the compilation of the
                    eegdev core library. (yes by default)


USB devices on Linux
====================

On linux (maybe on other platforms as well), usual users cannot access
directly to usb devices. A rules for udev is shipped in the package to make
any connected USB device accessible to users belonging to the plugdev
group. If it is not always necessary: on some systems, the configuration
already makes the device accessible.

To install this rule file, just type (after configure) with root permission:
	make install-usb-plugdev

To uninstall this files, again with root permission:
	make uninstall-usb-plugdev
